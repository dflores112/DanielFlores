<h2> 🌉 Two Cities 🌉</h2>

<p>
  My favorite <a href="https://github.com/dflores112/TwoCities">project</a> I have worked on so far during my development experience is where I was able to implement a data visualization library. I was able to use Chart.js to compare different cities based on Teleport API data by pulling different data points and displaying a stacked bar chart. I deployed using GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment.

<h2>TopTable 🥃 </h2>

<p>
  For this project I inherited another engineers front end calendar reservation service and built out the back end to maintain real time traffic. I enjoyed comparing and documenting both Cassandra and PostgreSQL tradeoffs. After comparing I scaled the service to hit 1375 requests per second from an initial 400 requests per second.

<h2> Employee Search 🔍</h2>

<p>
  Here is a <a href="https://github.com/dflores112/EmployeeSearch">project</a> I worked on that I am proud due to short two day time frame where 95% of the application was built within the first day. I used MongoDB to store employee info and built with React on the front end with Styled-Components. I am most proud of the testing I was able do with a total of 10 Enzyme-Jest tests checking all components for correct rendering.

<h2>Similar Homes 🏡 </h2>

<p>
  For this <a href="https://github.com/dflores112/similarHomes">project</a> I worked with two other engineers where we developed a housing listing service and each built a custom component using React and deployed using AWS and Docker from scratch. I enjoyed working with Styled-Components while devloping my carousel service and built a custom modal to display saved homes. We held daily standups, performed code reviews, and used Enzyme-Jest testing.
