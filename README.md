<h2>TopTable 🥃 </h2>

<p>
  For this project I inherited another engineers front end calendar reservation service and built out the back end to maintain real time traffic. I enjoyed comparing and documenting both Cassandra and PostgreSQL tradeoffs. After comparing I scaled the service to hit 1375 requests per second from an initial 400 request per second.

<h2>Similar Homes 🏡 </h2>

<p>
  For this project I with two other engineers where we developed a housing listing service and each built a custom component using React and deployed using AWS and Docker from scratch. I enjoyed working with Styled-Components while devloping my carousel service and built a custom modal to display saved homes. We held daily standups, performed code reviews, and used Enzyme-Jest testing.

<p>
  My favorite project I have worked on so far during my development experience where I was able to implement a data visualization library. I was able to use Chart.js to compare different cities based Teleport API data by pulling different data points and display using a stacked bar chart. I deployed using GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment.
