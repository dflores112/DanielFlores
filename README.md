  For this project I inherited another engineers front end calendar reservation service and built out the back end to maintain real time traffic. I enjoyed comparing and documenting both Cassandra and PostgreSQL tradeoffs. After comparing I scaled the service to hit 1375 requests per second from an initial 400 request per second.
